               <p>As Arthur, John, Michael and Polly prepare to hang for their crimes, Tommy's reprieve comes just in time to save their lives. A year later, the Shelby family is scattered and estranged from one another. Ada returns from Boston for Christmas and visits each of them: John and Esme continue their relationship of sex and arguments, Arthur remains stifled by Linda's watchful eye, Michael uses cocaine to stay on top of the business, and Polly has fallen into an alcohol-fuelled mania, taking prescribed tablets to quell her visions of spirits. Tommy advises Michael to dispose of Polly's medication and help her through her mental illness without them. Each of the Shelbys receives a letter from Luca Changretta, a black hand in New York City's Sicilian Mafia, marking him or her for death in retribution for the murder of Angel and Vincente. Tommy and Ada attempt to convince the others to meet on Boxing Day, believing that they will be safer if they come back together. However, when Tommy discovers and kills a mafia agent among his staff, he realises the assassination attempts are due to take place on Christmas Day and gets word to the rest of the family. Michael goes to collect John and Esme, with whom Tommy could not get in contact. A cart pulls up, and John and Michael are riddled by a hail of bullets.</p>
    
               <h2 class="text-danger mt-3 mb-3"><a href="https://www.mytrustworth.com/literature/seasons/english-seasons/peaky-blinders-online-english/peaky-blinders-season-4-online-english/peaky-blinders-season-4-episode-2-online-engish/"target="_blank">EPISODE-2("Heathens")</a></h2>
               <p>Michael survives his injuries but John is killed. In the wake of his death, Tommy and the rest of the Shelby family agree to put their differences aside while they deal with the mafia threat. Tommy suggests contacting Aberama Gold, a killer-for-hire, something Polly is strongly against. Disobeying her orders, Tommy uses John's funeral to draw Gold out so that they can make a tentative deal. Enraged, Polly attempts to get Michael to flee with her to Australia but he refuses until she helps the family through their current predicament, something she reluctantly agrees to do. Linda discovers that Ada is under investigation by the government because of her marriage to a communist but doesn't pass the message on. Gold agrees to fight for the Shelbys if they take on his son, Bonnie. After seeing him knock out a man much larger than he, Tommy and Arthur induct him into the Peaky Blinders. Jessie rallies Tommy's workforce and convinces the entire factory to strike. Changretta visits Tommy and sets several bullets on the table, stating that each is for a member of the Shelby family. He plans to keep Tommy alive until the rest are dead but insists that their vendetta be an honourable one, with Tommy agreeing not to involve the police or the death of children or civilians.</p>

               <p>The Italians launch another attack on the Peaky Blinders. Tommy realises that the Shelbys need to evolve if they are to survive, but some of the family are reluctant to part with tradition. As the strike takes hold at the Lanchester factory, Tommy pays a personal visit to Jessie Eden, but he is outmanoeuvred when she reveals something she knows about his past. Changretta plots to continue the vendetta in the most devastating way possible. As well as identifying an enemy of the Shelby family who could help him, Luca makes direct contact with someone at the heart of the Peaky Blinders organisation.</p>

               <p>The Peaky Blinders are lured by the Italians into a cat-and-mouse chase on the streets of Birmingham, where it becomes clear that the Italians are outmatched. Trapped in Small Heath, Tommy tries to console himself with a visit from an old flame but it soon becomes clear that he can't always get what he wants. As his factory lies idle, Tommy confronts the possibility that the Communists might win and he will be deemed a traitor to his class. Polly tells Michael about the deal she made with Changretta, but Michael decides not to tell Tommy.</p>

               <p>Thomas Shelby has figured out Polly has betrayed him but goes to the meeting Polly has set for him and finds himself engaged in bloody battle with Luca Changretta and his gang. Thomas has prepared for the battle ahead of time and manages to single-handedly kill three of Luca's gang members before coming face to face with Luca, however, the police arrive and break up the fight. The family gather to find out what happened, Tommy explains what happened, it appears he had been in on it with Polly. Lizzie Stark has even greater news to break. Polly Shelby shares a rather magical woodland scene with Aberama Gold. Meanwhile, an army colonel has questions for Ada Shelby about her past as a communist, and Jessie Eden confirms just how far she is prepared to go in pursuit of her cause. And sensing an opportunity to capitalize on his situation, Luca Changretta makes his way to London to present a plan to Alfie Solomons.</p>
    
               <h2 class="text-danger mt-3 mb-3"><a href="https://www.mytrustworth.com/literature/seasons/english-seasons/peaky-blinders-online-english/peaky-blinders-season-4-online-english/peaky-blinders-season-4-episode-6-online-engish/"target="_blank">EPISODE-6("The Company")</a></h2>
               <p>As the stage is set for the boxing match between Bonnie Gold and Goliath, Tommy gets a visit from Alfie. The Shelby girls meet to discuss Lizzie's pregnancy. Tommy watches the match ringside with Arthur who is suspicious of Goliath's seconds. When one of the seconds leaves the arena, Arthur follows and attacks him, and appears to be mortally wounded in the fight that ensues. At Arthur's funeral, the widow Changretta approaches with a white flag. Later at the family home, she reveals the vendetta will be over if Tommy signs over all his assets to Luca Changretta. Luca and his men meet with the remaining Shelbys in Tommy's basement distillery for Tommy to sign over his possessions. Tommy reveals to Luca that he has sent Michael to America to negotiate with other American mafiosi and turn Luca's men against him (despite treating him with contempt for not telling him he was about to be killed). Realizing he has been outmanoeuvred, Luca attacks Tommy, and a fight ensues. As Tommy is getting the upper hand, Arthur enters the distillery and shoots Luca. It is revealed that Tommy had Arthur fake his death to lure Luca into the trap. The Shelbys celebrate the end of the vendetta at Tommy's countryside estate, and it is announced that Tommy will take a holiday from the business. Tommy confronts Alfie for his betrayal, who reveals he did so knowing Tommy would track him down and kill him, and that he has cancer. Tommy then shoots Alfie and proceeds to take his holiday. However, as the boredom from fishing and golf sets in, Tommy's post-traumatic stress comes back, and he returns to Small Heath. Tommy returns to Shelby Company, Ltd., and contacts Jessie to let her know he wants to help her and thus acquires the name of her Communist party contacts. He takes this information to the Crown to secure an endorsement for his campaign for Member of Parliament, an election which Tommy wins.</p>
